! Building a Culture of Peace

## Vision
<!-- CHECK SECTION -->
Our world is rapidly changing and we need to find ways of engaging uncertainty and fear.   
As we face finitude and crisis, I want us to be able to retain our ability to cooperate.  
I want us to be able to hold love for one another, not succumbing to fear, othering, hatred and violence.

For this we need a culture which supports peace.

[_Let's work together_](#contact)

## what I offer
For learning about ourselves and each other and building a culture of peace I offer:

- [practice groups and workshops around Nonviolent Communication (NVC\)](#practice-groups-and-workshops)
- [sessions for individuals](#individuals)
- [sessions for people in relationship](#relationship)
- [sessions for groups working or living together](#groups)
- [offers to businesses](#businesses)

##  why I do what I do
I believe in order to make anything we do in the direction of change sustainable (whether it is action to stop wrongs or constructive action to build the future we want to see), we need a supportive culture. The culture we are currently living in is supporting the destruction and depletion of our planet. It also supports violent ways of relating with ourselves and each other, perpetuating pain and suffering.
**Therefore, we need cultural change and that is what I am working towards.**

Nonviolent Communication is a spiritual practice, as meditation can be called a spiritual practice. It's about observing ourselves, other human beings, our relationships with them and communication with ourselves and them.  
NVC puts connection first. This allows people to understand each other at the heart level, making the flow of gifts, of giving and receiving, natural.  
With this NVC has a radical potential to bring about change, as it questions currently dominant cultural norms.

## practice groups and workshops
<!-- CHECK SECTION -->

_Peace starts with each and everyone of us right now._  

Practice groups are a way of practicing and integrating what we know on a cognitive level. Together with others we can face the things we find challenging and be held in presence and compassion.


I offer regular open practice groups:  

- **Conflict Facilitation Practice Group:** Every first Saturday of the month. More information and sign up [here](https://nvc-uk.com/practice-group/conflict-facilitation-practice-group/).

Upcoming open workshops:

## individuals

### Life matters:
- Do you feel overwhelmed or just need someone to talk to?
- Are you struggling with someone in your life and are you longing for respect and care in your relationship?  
- Do you feel you have to be perfect while sometimes feeling hollow or completely depleted?  
- Do your children drive you crazy or have they turned away from you?  
- Do you long for your partner to just get you?

I am happy to offer a compassionate and safe space for exploring the difficult and sometimes painful matters of life. Whether it is conflicts with family, friends or at work; the challenges (polyamous) relationships throw at you or dysfunctional patterns you find yourself in because of fear, shame or trauma:  
_I can be present with you and offer guidance in your process._

### Leadership matters
- Would you like to be able to communicate in a way that truly brings others on board?
- Do you feel like people disempower themselves in your presence?
- Do you want to learn how to effect change for the better in your organisation without having the structural power?

Being in a position of leadership or taking leadership in a specific area comes with its own set of challenges. While taking that position, many eyes are on you and continuously holding the whole can become challenging. I can help you communicate more clearly, oriented towards vision and purpose. I can help you meet those you lead or are aiming to lead with enough curiosity and acceptance so that magic can happen. Being connected and approachable while at the same time being focused on purpose and having clear discernment are not mutually exclusive and I can help you embody that.

## relationship
- Do you long for togetherness with another person, but again and again you end up in arguments or disconnection?
- Would you like the pain that's in you to be heard and understood by the other person?
- Do you feel desperate and sometimes think it's impossible to agree on something together?

Whether you are in an intimate relationship, a friendship, polyamorous, neighbourly or in family relationships, sometimes these relationships can become painful or are outright disfunctional. Still they are important for our lives. I can help restore connection, understanding and trust. If both (all) of you want it, I can facilitate the dialogue between you.

I have personal experience with being in polyamorous relationships and can offer coaching and guidance for people being in (or open to) intimate and caring connection with multiple people.

## groups
- Do you anticipate that conflict might tear you apart or are you already experiencing conflict?
- Would you like to find ways of supporting togetherness and engaging conflict effectively?
- Do you want to find ways of leaving society's disfunctional default solutions behind and creating ways of being and working together that support your vision?
- Do you long for accompanyment along the way from someone who isn't as closely involved?

For groups who are working or living together (or intending to do so), I offer different packages depending on what you need.

## about me
I have been studying and teaching about NVC since 2014, just before my daughter was born. Now, I'm living in a yurt in rural Wales together with my partner Nicco and our two children. In 2020 we moved here from Germany.

I have a Master of Science in IT-Systems Engineering, which means I have learned how to develop software. As I was doing that, I discovered for myself the vanity of writing software, because software does not touch on the deep emotional and social problems we struggle with. At best it utilizes human psychology to capitalize on us, or streamlines buerocratic processes.
And because I am a radical, I have turned my back on software development and have turned to NVC and understanding human beings in a holistic way.

My eduction in software development has trained me for designing systems, clear communication as well as quick iterations and trying things out. 

In some ways I have been lucky, because I started my journey of integration and healing when I was about 15 years old. A man wiser than me, was able to meet me and hold up a mirror for me to see. He told me that if I would continue on the path I was on (stark rationality, shut-down of feelings and deemphasis of relationships) I would not be happy. At first I was angry at him, but the truth shone through for me and I conceded he was right. I set out on my journey to reclaim my emotions and rediscover myself. When I came in contact with NVC in 2014 it felt like coming home and finally finding oxygen.

Since then I have learned a lot. Most notably about shame and vulnerability. I have been particularly interested in interpersonal neurobiology (attachment theory, polyvagal theory...) as a result I have reclaimed a portion of my authenticity.
Social justice is a topic that has always been dear to me and equality of worth is one of my core values. My approach in meeting the deep need of justice - which everyone carries - has been my engagement with Restorative Circles, the work of Dominic Barter and my engagement with [Nonviolent Global Liberation](https://nglcommunity.org), the work of Miki Kashtan. I'm passionate about finding different ways of engaging which allow us to be together more and more of the time in a loving and collaborative way.

Since 2020 I'm living in rural Wales together with my family. I have two wonderful children who are 7 and 4 years old and I have my amazing partner Nicco, with whom I have been for over 10 years now.
We live off-grid in a yurt and enjoy a very simple lifestyle, which has taught me a lot.

Whenever you give me money please consider these different amounts:

## Complaints Procedure
While it is never my intention to harm, I know that sometimes inadvertently something I do or say may be painful or dissatisfying.  
If you are dissatisfied in any way with any service you receive from me, including workshops, events and one to one sessions, I'm interested in hearing your feedback. I want to learn and also honour your experience.

If you want to share your complaint with me, I invite you to consider the following steps as guidance for how to proceed:  

**1.   Get some support**  
If you are feeling very charged, please consider getting support. If we are very upset or angry we sometimes end up doing or saying things we regret later. Also, my "neural-wifi" is always on, meaning that I will probably pick up on how you are. That might send me into stress and make it more difficult for us to understand each other. Receiving empathy and support first can help you be grounded and firm in what's important to you, without feeling like it's an emergency.

**2.   Contact me**  
Contact me with your complaint. (Or ask a friend or support person to contact me.)  If it's fitting, let me know your complaint by email (kirstin.heidler@yahoo.com). Please put the word ‘Complaint’ in the subject header. 

​If one of us senses it's needed, we will have a conversation for me to hear your complaints and for you to be heard with what's on your heart. Ideally we find a mutually satisfying resolution of the issue. If you are satisfied, this is the end of the process.  
​
_If at the end of this process, you are not satisfied with the outcome:_

**3.   Contact CTW**  
If the steps before didn't work out for you or you don't feel comfortable with contacting me directly, you can contact  the Conflict Transformation Weave. They will follow this procedure. You can find information about and ways of contacting the CTW at: [https://ctw-uk.com](https://ctw-uk.com)
